TASK 2

This task requires creation of Middleware to validate data and return back the result to the data
collector to correct them.
Possible invalidation could be as follows:
a) Missing rows and/or columns.
b) Missing data in a perticular cell.
c) Monthly savings being more than monthly income
d) Inappropriate Dates.

Requirements:
1. A database table with keys like the following:

    CREATE TABLE client_income_data(
    client_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    client_email VARCHAR(255),
    client_name VARCHAR(255), 
    income_per_annum FLOAT,
    savings_per_annum FLOAT,
    mobile_number VARCHAR(15));

2. A filtering code to find out the issues in the database.
   This code will tell the data collector the missing validation points.

Working:
> Creation of database and inserting values
> Finding if rows are valid or not
> Finding if a perticular cell is valid or not
> Returing the end results using POST.

Pros:
> Using this middleware can help in reduction of mistakes in data entry.
> A proper message enables the user to know the relevant invalid points.

Cons
> The validation is limited to the instruction provided.
> Intentionally left blank cells/rows become invalid.
