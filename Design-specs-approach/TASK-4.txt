TASK 4

A recent client partner wanted us to send an SMS to the customer whose details are
collected in the response as soon as the ingestion was complete reliably. The content
of the SMS consists of details of the customer, which were a part of the answers in
the response. This customer was supposed to use this as a “receipt” for them having
participated in the exercise.
Creating a Middleware to send message to user/client after successfully recording a response.

Working:
> Make a code to send sms after successful record of response.

Pros:
> If deployed on a dyanmic server this could be used as a failsafe and can scale to cases 
  like millions of responses

Cons:
> Proper deployment is necessary
